# Locally-made-Pedal-Driven-Pump
This repository is dedicated to the development of an open-source hardware bicycle-driven water pump, aimed at providing an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution for water transportation and irrigation in rural areas. The project includes detailed schematics, assembly instructions, and software for monitoring and optimizing pump performance.

## Requirements:

- Design and develop a longer-lasting, more durable water pump station for rural communities without electricity access.

## Ideas:
- Change the pump actuator.
  - Use a mechanical bicycle drive instead of a hand pump.
  - Convert the rotation from the bicycle to mechanical power for pumping water.
  - Alternatively, convert the rotation to electrical power as a cost-effective alternative to solar panel generation.

## Needs:
- Conduct research on existing projects.
- Develop a design concept.
- Provide a detailed description suitable for student project work (e.g., bachelor or master thesis).
